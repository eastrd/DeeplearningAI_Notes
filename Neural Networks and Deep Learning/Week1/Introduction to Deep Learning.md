# What is a neural network?
#### Housing Price Prediction (Linear Regression):
- can be a really simple neural network: <br> <b> Size -> O -> Price </b>
- A large neural network is formed by stacking these neurons.
- It can also be: <br>
<b> X -> [O , O , ...] -> O -> Y  </b>
, where X is <i> [size, #bedrooms, zipcode, wealth] </i> and Y is the <i> price. </i>
